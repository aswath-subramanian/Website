    <h1>De-risking the transition from lab-scale technology to industrial reality.</h1>

    <p>
      I am an engineer working at the intersection of energy systems, 
      manufacturing processes, and scale-up risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      My long-term direction is advisory: helping teams identify where 
      technically sound ideas become fragile in execution — 
      pilot lines, new materials, and processes moving from prototype to factory.

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Teams scaling a process that works in the lab but not yet in production.</li>
      <li>Engineers facing uncertain process windows or yield behaviour.</li>
      <li>Organisations where technical and operational realities are misaligned.</li>
      <li>Projects where early design decisions carry long-term risk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      I work best where mistakes are still reversible and architecture is still flexible.

      <h3>Preventing throughput collapse during a 4.5× scale-up</h3>
      <p><span class="label">Failure risk</span> A rigid box production line was projected to scale output by increasing shifts and operator load, without understanding physical bottlenecks.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Intervention</span> Analysed operator constraints, process capability, and physical line layout to identify where throughput would fail under increased load.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Outcome</span> Scaled production from ~2,000 to 9,000+ units/day while maintaining ISO 9001 compliance and stable defect rates.</p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      My work style is analytical, constraint-driven, and grounded in physical reality.
      I focus less on optimisation frameworks and more on understanding where systems 
      will fail under real operating conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The underlying pattern across my experience is identifying 
      latent failure modes before they turn into cost, yield, or reliability problems.
    </p>

<section id="background">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I have worked across thin-film PV R&D, residential solar system design, 
      and high-volume manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technical foundation is in mechanical engineering and sustainable energy systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently building a transition towards independent advisory work in 
      energy and manufacturing scale-up.

    <p>
      If you are facing a scale-up decision, a process robustness question, 
      or a design-to-operations gap, I am open to conversations.
